## For developers

Mac or Linux

Install git, nodejs, coffeescript

### Environment

Open console.


**Setup**

Clone the project

`git clone https://github.com/govwiki/govwiki.us.git`

Change directory to govwiki.us/

`cd govwiki.us`

install dependencies

`npm install`


**Development**

Run the development environment

`npm run dev`

Open a browser http://localhost:8080

You should see the first page of the site. 
In the center of the upper border of page there should be a tiny red word 'live'. 
That means that live preview is working.


Every time you save jade, coffee or stylus files they are automatically compiled 
to HTML, javascript and CSS files, the project is rebuilded and live-preview reloads 
the page in the browser window. So you should see changes in your files on the page immediately.

To keep things simple, the project does not use any framework (such as AngularJS, Backbone etc).
We can begin to use frameworks, later when the technology stack is settled.
